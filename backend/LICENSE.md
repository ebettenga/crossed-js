# Crossed JS Shared Source License

Copyright (c) 2024 Ethan Bett and contributors.

## Purpose
This project is shared so that others can study the code, file issues, and contribute improvements. It is **not** a license to publish or distribute the application on commercial or public app marketplaces without the explicit consent of the repository owner.

## Grant of Permission
Subject to the conditions below, you are permitted to:

- View, clone, and fork this repository.
- Run the software locally for personal evaluation and development.
- Modify the software and submit those modifications back to this project (e.g., through pull requests or patches).

## Restrictions

- You may not publish, submit, or otherwise distribute this application (modified or unmodified) to any app management store, marketplace, or similar distribution channel without prior written permission from the repository owner.
- You may not offer or sell this application as a paid service or product without written consent from the repository owner.
- You must retain this license in all copies or substantial portions of the software.

## No Warranty
This software is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and noninfringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.

## Termination
Any violation of the Restrictions section automatically terminates your rights under this license. Upon termination, you must destroy all copies of the software in your possession.
